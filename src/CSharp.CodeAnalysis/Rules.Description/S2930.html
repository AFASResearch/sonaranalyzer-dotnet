<p>
    You can't rely on garbage collection to clean up everything. Specifically, you can't count on
    it to release non-memory resources such as <code>File</code>s. For that, there's the <code>IDisposable</code>
    interface, and the contract that <code>Dispose</code> will always be called on such objects.
</p>
<p>
    When an <code>IDisposable</code> is a class member, then it's up to that class to call <code>Dispose</code>
    on it, ideally in its own <code>Dispose</code> method.
</p>
<p>
    This rule raises issues on members that are never <code>Dispose</code>d.
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class ResourceHolder 
{
  private FileStream fs;  // Noncompliant; Dispose is never called
  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }
  public void CloseResource()
  {
    this.fs.Close();
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public class ResourceHolder  : IDisposable
{
  private FileStream fs;
  public void OpenResource(string path)
  {
    this.fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  }
  public void CloseResource()
  {
    this.fs.Close();
  }

  public void Dispose() 
  {
    this.fs.Dispose();
  }
}
</pre>
