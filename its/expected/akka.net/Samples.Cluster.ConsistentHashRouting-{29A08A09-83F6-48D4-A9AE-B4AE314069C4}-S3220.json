"shortMessage":  "Review this call, which partially matches an overload without \"params\". The partial match is \"ConsistentHashingGroup.ConsistentHashingGroup(Config config)\".",
"fullMessage":  "The rules for method resolution are complex and perhaps not properly understood by all coders. The \"params\" keyword can make method declarations overlap in non-obvious ways, so that slight changes in the argument types of an invocation can resolve to different methods. This rule raises an issue when an invocation resolves to a method declaration with \"params\", but could also resolve to another non-\"params\" method too.",
