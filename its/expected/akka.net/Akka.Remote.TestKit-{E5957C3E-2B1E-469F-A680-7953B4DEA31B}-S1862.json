"fullMessage":  "A chain of \"if\"/\"else if\" statements is evaluated from top to bottom. At most, only one branch will be executed: the first one with a condition that evaluates to \"true\". Therefore, duplicating a condition automatically leads to dead code. Usually, this is due to a copy/paste error. At best, it\u0027s simply dead code and at worst, it\u0027s a bug that is likely to induce further bugs as the code is maintained, and obviously it could lead to unexpected behavior.",
