"shortMessage":  "This file has 1090 lines, which is greater than 1000 authorized. Split it into smaller files.",
"fullMessage":  "A source file that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain. Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor it into smaller pieces of code which focus on well defined tasks. Those smaller files will not only be easier to understand but also probably easier to test.",
